chrome-better-bookmark
======================

simple chrome extension that adds a new browser button to quickly add bookmarks to the selected category (with fewer mouse clicks then using the native 'star' button)

TODO
====

 - more aesthetic style
 - keyboard shortcut
 - icon should be greyed out by default, highlighted if the page is already bookmarked
 - options (font size and style, focus style, key bindings, sorting options)
 - TBD: subcategory indentation?
